# Natural Language Processing (NLP) â€“ Internship Tasks  

This repository contains the NLP projects I completed as part of my internship at **Elevvo Pathways**.  
The tasks cover sentiment analysis, classification, fake news detection, and named entity recognition.

##  Internship Overview  
The internship focused on applying foundational to intermediate-level NLP techniques, including:  
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
- Feature engineering (TF-IDF, vectorization)  
- Machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)  
- Named Entity Recognition (rule-based and model-based with spaCy)  
- Visualization with WordCloud and spaCyâ€™s displaCy

##  Repository Structure  

- **Task1_SentimentAnalysis.ipynb** â†’ Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews  
  - Dataset: IMDb / Amazon product reviews  
  - Objective: Classify reviews as Positive / Negative  

- **Task2_NewsClassification.ipynb** â†’ News Category Classification  
  - Dataset: AG News  
  - Objective: Classify news into categories (Sports, Business, Politics, Tech)  

- **Task3_FakeNewsDetection.ipynb** â†’ Fake News Detection  
  - Dataset: Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)  
  - Objective: Detect whether a news article is real or fake  

- **Task4_NER_First5Sentences.ipynb** â†’ Named Entity Recognition (NER) on News Articles (first 5 sentences only)  
  - Used spaCy rule-based + model-based NER  
  - Extracted PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE  

- **Task5_NER_FullData.ipynb** â†’ Named Entity Recognition (NER) on full news article dataset  
  - Same as Task 4 but applied to the complete dataset instead of just the first 5 sentences
